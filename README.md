# RISC-V cpu 

**RISC-V**(pronounced "risk-five") is a new instruction-set architecture(**ISA**) that was originally designed to support computer architecture research and education, but which we now hope will also become a standard free and open architecture for industry implementations.
My goals:
**Step by step to complete the design of the reduced instryction set CPU and FPGA impementation.**
This project include dirc belowï¼š
- risc-v knowledge
- Computer Architecture
- hardware
- script
- software
